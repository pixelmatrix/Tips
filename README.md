# Tips
Tip Calculator Assignment for CodePath

This is an iOS app that calculates how much to tip based on an amount entered. It was written in Swift, and partially inspired by the demo video and instructions.

Time spent: Approximately 6 hours

##### Completed User Stories:
* [x] User can enter an amount and see how much to tip, and the new total with tip
* [x] User can adjust tip amount
* [x] User can see the bill split multiple ways

##### Notes:
Added some nice finishing touches here. The main calculator view animates into the center of the screen when the field is focused. I've made it so the field only accepts valid currency, and always shows two decimal places. There's a progressive delay in the transition for each of the split totals. The fonts are all custom as well.
